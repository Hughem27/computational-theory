## Overview
This repository is part of the Computational Theory module for fourth year ATU Computer Science 2024/25. The module is based on the fundamental principles that underpin computation, algorithms, and the limits of what machines can solve. Throughout the module, the focus has been on understanding both the mathematical theory of computation and applying this theory through practical programming tasks that simulate or analyze computational processes. Through the tasks for this module a clear understanding was obtained about the foundational bread and butter of computing. The module is clearly outlined in the [instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/assessment/instructions.md) section.
 

## Repository Structure

- `tasks.ipynb`: Contains the Jupyter notebook with solutions to the assessment [tasks](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/assessment/tasks.md).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
- `input_file_path.txt`: This file is read in in Task 3 as specified in the brief.
- `requirements.txt`: This file contains all dependencies, when below instructions followed automatically installs all dependencies for the project.

## Instructions to run
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hughem27/computational-theory.git 
   ```

2. **Change Directory** 
    ```bash
    cd computational-theory-assessment
    ```

3. **Create Python Virtual Enviroment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Tasks 
   In the tasks file of the assessment brief there is a clear outline of the tasks and all the task statements that can be seen in the [tasks](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/assessment/tasks.md) section. 

## Objectives
The objectives of this module from a personal perspective was to gain a deeper understanding of the foundations of computing and to create a professional notebook logging the progress of this research while also adhering to the guidelines recommended for this module.

### Presentation 
|Guideline | Approach Taken|
|-|-|
   | Well-organized and clean repository structure | No unnecessary files in the repository |
   | Clear narrative in notebooks | Markdown cells with clear explanation fo each task and each code block with clear comments | 
   | Repository contents and purpose are easy to understand | ReadMe with overview section detailing the purpose of the repository |

### Research 
|Guideline | Approach Taken|
|-|-|
   | Evidence of research on relevant topics| Urls to research used for each task with few lines explaining how each reference was useful  |
   | Building upon the literature and documentation | When referencing documentation like for the Java hash method used the documentation as referenced then outlined how the method used in this notebook differed or was similar and how it was used to implement this version|
   | Appropriate referencing and comparisons to similar work | All references used have clear links to each task and why they were chosen is outlined |
### Documentation
|Guideline | Approach Taken|
|-|-|
   |Clear and concise explanations of concepts | Markdowns for each concept with the explanation of how it works and also markdowns breaking down how the code works from a higher level|
   |Informative comments in code | Clear comments for most code. Any non-obvious lines of code commented clearly|
   |Inclusion of standard repository files | Requirements.txt and readme defined with clear instructions|
### Development
|Guideline | Approach Taken|
|-|-|
|Correct, efficient, and clean code | Best practices followed for all code including Python, Jupyter and GitHub Documentation. GitHub smart commits used with issues to track development progress and documentation to  professional standard |
|Use of standard programming structures, algorithms, and tests | Standards followed in accordance with documentation of Python, Jupyter and GitHub |
|Clean architecture | Clear and minimal style of architecture |
### Consistency
|Guideline | Approach Taken|
|-|-|
|A detailed commit history with many incremental changes | Commits were only made when code was correct and fully function, as following a professional standard|
| Steady work on tasks throughout the semester | Clear work over time made, slightly scattered due to life and college commitments but clear work over time |
|Evidence of review and refinement in the repository | Changes to old code and reviewal of code clear with comments added over time|
